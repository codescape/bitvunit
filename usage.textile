public class SampleHamcrestMatchersWithXmlRuleSetTest {

    @Test
    public void checkBitvUnitHomepage() throws Exception {
        HtmlPage pageUnderTest = new WebClient().getPage("http://bitvunit.codescape.de");
        assertThat(pageUnderTest, is(compliantTo(new XmlRuleSet("/rulesets/all-rules.xml"))));
    }

}
