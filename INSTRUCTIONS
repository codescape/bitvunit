This file contains a collection of instructions to accomplish different tasks that are repeatedly performed from time to time. 

Updating dependency versions
----------------------------
1. Run `mvn versions:display-dependency-updates` to produce a list of all dependencies where a newer versions exists.
2. Update POMs to use new dependency versions where accurate. Release candidates and milestone releases should be used carefully.
3. Run `mvn verify` to make sure everything works fine with the new versions of the dependencies.

Releasing a new version
-----------------------
1. Run `mvn clean test` and verify that all test are running.
2. Run `mvn release:prepare` and set the release version (e.g.: 0.5.0), the SCM tag (e.g.: v0.5.0) and the development version (e.g.: 0.6.0-SNAPHOT).
3. Verify the results and run `mvn release:perform` if everyhting is looking fine.
4. Login at https://oss.sonatype.org and verify the generated artifacts in the `Staging Repository` are okay.
5. `Close` the Build in the `Staging Repository` and then `Release` the new version to Maven Central.

Implementing new rules
----------------------
1. Run the wizard with the command `groovy bitvunit.groovy create-rule` from the root folder of the project. (Groovy required)
2. Enter your full name so that it appears in the JavaDoc of the newly created rule.
3. Enter an informative name for your new rule.
4. Choose from one of the existing rule categories.
5. Implement the tests. The two already existing test cases are not a limit and you can create more if required.
6. Implement the new rule and make sure all unit tests are passing.
