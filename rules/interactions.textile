h3. AvoidMetaRefreshRule

<aside class="rule-meta">
    <ul>
        <li class="author">Author: Stefan Glase</li>
        <li class="version">Since: 0.2</li>
    </ul>
</aside>

AvoidMetaRefreshRule ensures that there is no fixed refresh caused by the <code><meta http-equiv="refresh" content="seconds; URL=target" /></code> tag within the given HTML document. Automatically updating pages may cause significant accessibility problems to people that are disabled or that use technology that hinders normal interactions patterns.
