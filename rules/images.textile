h3. AlternativeTextForAreaOfImageMapRule

<aside class="rule-meta">
    <ul>
        <li class="author">Author: Stefan Glase</li>
        <li class="version">Since: 0.3</li>
    </ul>
</aside>

AlternativeTextForAreaOfImageMapRule ensures that every area of an image map created by the <code><area/></code> tag within the given HTML document provides an alternative text through its <code>alt</code> attribute.

h3. AlternativeTextForImageRule

<aside class="rule-meta">
    <ul>
        <li class="author">Author: Stefan Glase</li>
        <li class="version">Since: 0.1</li>
    </ul>
</aside>

AlternativeTextForImageRule ensures that every image created by the <code><img/></code> tag within the given HTML document provides an alternative text through its <code>alt</code> attribute. This rule is already satisfied by an empty attribute <code>alt=""</code> since this is the encouraged way for images that are used for layout aspects.

h3. AvoidServerSideImageMapRule

<aside class="rule-meta">
    <ul>
        <li class="author">Author: Stefan Glase</li>
        <li class="version">Since: 0.4</li>
    </ul>
</aside>

AvoidServerSideImageMapRule ensures that there are no server side image maps created by the <code><img ismap="ismap"/></code> tag within the given HTML document because they are inaccessible by users who cannot use a mouse because of some disability.
