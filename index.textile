BitvUnit is an open source accessibility testing library that makes it easy to automate accessibility checking for pages and applications that run in a web browser. BitvUnit is free, open source software licensed under the "Apache License, Version 2.0":http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html.

The library uses "Apache Maven":http://maven.apache.org for its build and dependency management. With the help of "HtmlUnit":http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net the library inspects HTML pages that are checked against the rules of the library. It provides adapters for "Hamcrest":http://code.google.com/p/hamcrest matchers because of their expressive syntax.
