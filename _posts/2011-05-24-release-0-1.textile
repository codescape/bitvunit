title: Releasing BitvUnit 0.1 - Initial Release
---

Two days before I started to work on the library and I am happy to annouce a first version of the library to the public.

There is already a working implementation of ten rules for accessibility testing. These rules can be applied to a given page to report violations or put together into a set of rules (<code>RuleSet</code>) that can also be applied to a given page to report violations.

{% highlight java %}
package demo;

// imports omitted

public class CheckSingleRuleTest {

    @Test
    public void checkBitvUnitHomepage() throws Exception {
        HtmlPage pageUnderTest = new WebClient().getPage("http://bitvunit.codescape.de");
        assertTrue(new LabelForSelectTagRule().applyTo(pageUnderTest).isEmpty());
    }

}
{% endhighlight %}

See the "Change Log":/changes/#r01 for further details.
