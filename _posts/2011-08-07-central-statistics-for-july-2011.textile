title: Central Statistics for July 2011
---

BitvUnit is now available in the "Central Maven Repository":CentralMavenRepository for a little bit more than one month. Statistics for July 2011 were published on the "Sonatype Nexus Maven Repository Browser":SonatypeNexus some days ago and show a total count of *20 downloads* from the Maven Central Repository. Downloads were exactly split up to 10 downloads of bitvunit-core 0.3.0 and 10 downloads to bitvunit-core 0.4.0.

h3. Feedback wanted

I want to use this blog post to send a *thank you* to everyone giving the library a try in the past or in the future! I am always happy to receive some feedback - be it bugs or requests for new features or rules!
