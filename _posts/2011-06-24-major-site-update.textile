title: Major site update
---

In the last two days I spent some free time on updating the documentation page you are currently reading in. Since today there is a first "Usage":/usage example available online and the "About":http://bitvunit.codescape.de has some nice icons pointing to the relevant resources you will need to deal with when using the framework.
