title: Releasing BitvUnit 0.7 - Demo Project, Priorities Concept, Selenium WebDriver Support
---

I am happy to announce the next version of BitvUnit! A new concept of priorities has been added and will be integrated deeper in the upcoming versions. You can then set thresholds that will make a test run fail or not fail depending on the amount of violations against the given rules in that priority level.

To help new users get started with the framework the demo project was improved and has been changed to a web project with own pages and tests against these pages. Have a look at the source code of the updated "bitvunit-demo":BitvUnitDemo project to find out more.

More details about changes in this version can be found in the "Change Log":ChangeLog.
